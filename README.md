# Work Day Scheduler  

## This week I was tasked to create a Scheduler App that a user could enter events for a time of the day and use to keep track of there daily tasks

## Challenges I Faced While Developing 

### This weeks project required me to learn how to navigate through third party API documentation. Specifically reading about the date object and moment js was some I hadn't done before and took me a bit to understand, for example comparing different times with moment methods. Although it was difficult at times it was rewarding in the end.
